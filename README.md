# Digging In

A tongue in check word play to define a Domain Specific Language for meta measurements in the DNS (for now)

## Introduction

We all have worked with RIPE Atlas and other measurements platforms, open and semi-closed, and ended up doing the same boilerplate of setting up core measurements on a regular basis with a set of probes, until the monitoring period ends or the expected situation materializes.

We'd like to define a language that will describe how to do some high level measurements, and implement highly-efficient providers of those measurements in existing measurement networks

## Use cases

### Monitor the propagation of one zone across all their authoritative nameservers

### Monitor serial number changes

###
